## Unreleased

- Android 11+: the plugin manifest now declares `<queries>` for the live-wallpaper, chooser, set-wallpaper, and crop-and-set intents. Without them package visibility hid the system wallpaper apps, so `getCapabilities()` reported live, OpenGL, and picker support as unavailable, and the video, OpenGL, picker, cropper, and chooser flows failed with `unsupported` or `system-ui-unavailable` on devices that had them.
- Wallpaper rotation no longer runs a foreground service. The interval and charging triggers use `WorkManager` and the time-of-day trigger uses one inexact alarm re-armed after each delivery, which removes the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` permissions and keeps charging/time-of-day rotation working on Android 14+ and Android 15+.
- Rotation sources now load through the same bounded loader as static wallpapers, so rotation URLs must be HTTPS and inherit the redirect, content-type, encoded-size, and decoded-pixel limits. This removes the Picasso dependency, which otherwise pulled OkHttp 3 into consumer release builds and broke R8 minification.
- Video live wallpapers keep an unconfirmed candidate separate from the active asset. A prepared candidate is promoted only when the plugin opens the live-wallpaper preview, so a candidate that is never previewed no longer replaces the active video. Once the system preview is open, Android owns the outcome; the plugin cannot detect that the user cancelled.
- The video scale mode is persisted with the active asset instead of being held in a process-global field, so `fitCenter` survives process death and cannot be applied to a different video.
- Static wallpapers and rotation now draw onto the display size instead of the launcher's desired size. That size is a wide virtual canvas (for example 4800x2400 on a 1080x2400 phone), and Android shows its left edge, so `fitCenter` and `center` produced an all-black screen and the other modes showed only a zoomed-in left strip of the image.
- Charging rotation now applies at most once per configured interval while the device is charging instead of once per plug-in event. Overnight active-hour windows (for example `22` to `6`) are supported, equal start/end hours mean a full-day window, and alarm scheduling no longer drifts by the window length.
- `startWallpaperRotation`, `stopWallpaperRotation`, `rotateWallpaperNow`, and `getWallpaperRotationStatus` now return an `unsupported` result / a not-running status off Android instead of falling through to a platform call.
- `getWallpaperRotationStatus()` no longer throws when the platform call fails; it returns a not-running status with `lastError` set instead.
- Results decided in Dart (unsupported platform, invalid input, transport exception) now fill `home`/`lock` for each requested target, the same way Android does, instead of leaving them null.
- An unsupported video scale mode (`center`, `fill`, `stretch`) now returns `unsupported` with `video-scale-unsupported`, as documented and as Android reports it. The Dart pre-check returned `failed` with `invalid-input`.
- OpenGL live wallpaper: an unexpected I/O error while reading a texture source during configuration is now reported as `texture-source-unavailable` instead of `configuration-store-failed`, matching what the renderer reports for the same failure.
- Internal: removed unused legacy platform-channel endpoints and dead pre-Android 7 code paths.
- Example (Android 12+): the example keeps one `FlutterEngine` for the process. A new wallpaper changes the dynamic colors, Android relaunches the Activity, and the default `FlutterActivity` destroyed its engine, so the example restarted and never showed the `applyWallpaper` result. The Android compatibility guide now explains this relaunch and how a host app can keep its result.

## 3.2.0

- Add structured Android static-wallpaper requests with URL, file-path, content-URI, and byte sources.
- Add explicit image scale modes and direct/system-cropper/system-picker/automatic apply strategies.
- Add truthful `WallpaperOperationResult` and per-target home/lock outcomes instead of treating a UI launch as an applied wallpaper.
- Add `getCapabilities()` for static, live, OpenGL, target, picker, foreground, OEM, and GLES availability checks.
- Add typed video preparation and live-preview APIs; preparation and Android user confirmation are now distinct statuses.
- Add bounded OpenGL ES 2.0 live-wallpaper support with shader validation and typed OpenGL requests.
- Serialize native wallpaper operations, preserve partial both-target results, and make direct static application safe for headless/background execution.
- Retain `goToHome` request fields for source compatibility while removing package-side automatic navigation.
- Make the live-wallpaper manifest feature optional, remove broad media/storage permissions, and expose overrideable live-wallpaper branding resources.
- Keep 3.1 APIs source-compatible; mark the legacy live-wallpaper shortcut deprecated in favor of structured results.
- Refresh the example, migration/API docs, Android compatibility notes, and the 3.2 issue-resolution ledger.
- OpenGL/video live-wallpaper flows are syntax- and state-machine-tested; GPU compile/link and OEM preview target selection still require physical device verification (see doc/android-compatibility.md).
